# Power-BI-dashboard-for-data-analytics

Developed a powerful Power BI dashboard using extensive data modeling and complex DAX queries utilising the wide range of visualizations and 
drill through filters provided by Power BI. <br>
The Power BI report could be used to view and visualize the data modeling as well as the Measures and calculated columns created during Data Engineering. <br>
A Report has been made to summarize the work done in the project. <br><br>
To run the report and see all insights, just change the path to all data files and folders in the Data Transformation window.
